        <h1>About Mallorca</h1>
        <p>
            Mallorca, also spelled Majorca, is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain located in the Mediterranean Sea. With a history that dates back to ancient times, Mallorca has been shaped by various civilizations including the Romans, Moors, and later the Christian reconquest in the 13th century.

            The island's strategic location made it a hub for trade and cultural exchange. During Roman rule, the city of Palma was founded and flourished. In 902 AD, the Moors conquered Mallorca, bringing advanced agriculture, architecture, and learning. In 1229, King James I of Aragon reconquered the island, integrating it into the Crown of Aragon.
